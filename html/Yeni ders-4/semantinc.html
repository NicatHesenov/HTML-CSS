                E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is an audiobook and soundtrack companion album for the 1982 blockbuster film directed by Steven Spielberg. Composed by John Williams, the album was narrated by Michael Jackson (pictured), and distributed by MCA Records. The original song "Someone in the Dark", sung by Jackson, bookends the album. The album was released on November 15, 1982 – before Jackson's album Thriller was released later that month – which led to a lawsuit by his label, Epic Records, over the soundtrack being released first. The soundtrack album was withdrawn, and the release of the single "Someone in the Dark" was prohibited. The album also featured a poster of Jackson with an animatronic model of E.T.; the image appeared on the cover of Ebony magazine the following month. Despite its curtailed release, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial reached number 37 on the Billboard 200 and number 82 on the UK Albums Chart. Well-received critically, it won Jackson a Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children. (Full article...)

                Wilhering Abbey is a Cistercian monastery in Wilhering in Upper Austria, about 8 km (5 mi) from the city of Linz. The buildings, re-constructed in the 18th century, are known for their spectacular Rococo decoration. According to the German art historian Cornelius Gurlitt, "the abbey church of Wilhering is the most brilliant achievement of the Rococo style in the German-speaking world". This photograph depicts the interior of the church, looking towards the high altar, featuring the intricate ceiling frescoes and stucco work.
